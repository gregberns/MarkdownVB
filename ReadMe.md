MarkdownVB is a direct port of [MarkdownSharp](https://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/source/browse/#hg%2FMarkdownSharp)

Port was done with Teleric's [Code Converter](http://converter.telerik.com/)

There were several issues after the port, and so modifications were made to the ported code. 

Tests still need to be ported.

### Known Issues

* Horizontal Rules - The Regex did not get ported properly
* Probably many more...

If you have fixes, please contribute!
